Our project uses Node.JS as backend and we hosted the code on GitHub. We have archived a **zip file of the code** and also uploaded to our team's final project folder.

We also included our **design process** in the Design Process folder in the projecy folder, including our sitemap, low-fi design and hi-fi design.
